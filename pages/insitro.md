> Machine Learning Engineering Intern - insitro, Summer 2022 

:::  {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

## TL;DR

 
Conducted cross-disciplinary neuron segmentation project using machine learning for the purposes of flourescent
phenotyping and disease modeling. Deployed models with an API. Used ViT, DINO, Segformer, DeepLabV3, etc.
Gained experience working with industry tools such as Amazon AWS EC2 & Batch, Weights & Biases.

## Experience 

In the Summer of 2022, I interned at [insitro](https://insitro.com/team), an ML-powered drug discovery company, led by Daphne Koller. My experience was nothing short of amazing, and I definately learned a ton. While I had a lot of machine learning engineering experience prior to coming to insitro, I lacked knowledge of industry tools. At insitro, I was able to broaden my horizons and learn about concepts such as **Amazon AWS, EC2, Batch; Weights and Biases; Git and Github pull requests; PyTorch distributed;** and much more. 

## Project 

In this section, I give a brief overview of the project I conducted during my time at insitro. 

> Project title: "**Exploring Experimental Machine Learning Strategies for Improving Neuron Segmentation Models**"
