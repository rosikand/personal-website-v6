Hey, I'm Rohan! I'm a student at **[The Farm](www.stanford.edu)** studying **Computer Science** with interests in **software development, machine learning, computer systems, and applied mathematics**. This is my personal home page where I keep a **[portfolio](portfolio.qmd)** of my work, among other things (such as a [**blog**](blog.qmd)). Most my work is on my [**Github**](https://github.com/rosikand). In my free time, I enjoy playing golf.
