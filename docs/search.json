But… most figures are quite large and take up majority of the page…\n\n\n\nno good! And guess what? There is no standard way to resize images in markdown! So you’d have to specify an HTML element like so:\n&lt;img src=\"http://www.fillmurray.com/460/300\"&gt;\nFrom here, you could in theory add image alignment and sizing, but this still takes another ~45 seconds:\n&lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\n    &lt;img alt=\"picture 1\" src=\"http://www.fillmurray.com/460/300\" width=\"350\" /&gt;  \n&lt;/p&gt;\nIn all, this whole process probably takes ~2 minutes per image. And if you are typing live during a lecture, you’ll quickly be lost in the content and won’t be able to keep up with the lecturer. For these reasons, after playing around with various ideas, I describe a new workflow below."

We will use this as the path since it eliminates the need to download, save, and specify the path locally.\n\nWe use a public Github repo to upload the images to automatically. This allows us to store our images on Github’s servers and retrieve a URL on the internet.\n\nNote: You can also use this setup with some other CDN delivery network that the Markdown Image extension allows for (such as Cloudflare). But I personally think Github is the safest and best option.\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\nMake a new Github repo to store the images.\nOpen up the config settings for the above extension in VS Code. Specify the following fields based on your account info and repo:\n\nbranch\npath (i.e., the folder inside your GH repo where you want to store the images)\nrepository name\ntoken (your personal access token)\n\nNow change the base upload method field to ‘Github’ in the extension settings.\n(Optional) while you are at it, you can also change the base image width in the extension settings, the code type (I prefer the HTML string over raw Markdown since it renders nicely in Github’s web interface), the max image width (I use 300-400).\n(Optional) if you want center-alignment, make a VS Code snippet with the following code:\n\n&lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\n     \n&lt;/p&gt;\nand then paste your image in between the element block dividers.\nAnd that’s it! All you need to do is copy an image to your clipboard (i.e., from a screenshot) and paste it in using the extension by right-clicking and select (if enabled and there is other extensions overwriting the command):\n\n\n\ndone! Now your image uploading should take about ~5 seconds (a much better improvement from ~2 minutes!)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In recent years, there has been a small movement of people trying to go from stateful (Python OOP, class-based modules) to stateless (pure functions) neural network code. The standard PyTorch nn.module is indeed a OOP-based class. But more recent libraries such as JAX, introduce the ability to feasiby create stateless (just functions!) machine learning models. Now, in PyTorch version 1.13, we have functorch in-tree (in the main package). Why stateless? Read this blog post for the differences, but some reasons for why I like stateless code is because:\n\nLess leaky abstractions (and less unknown abstractions in general!)\nCloser to the mathematical form (after all, a neural network is just a series of functions chained together!)\n\nWhen you learn SGD in class in the mathematical form and then use PyTorch, the disconnect is fairly evident.\n\nLess compute overhead (less things to keep track of internally –&gt; less memory needed)\nAbility to work a lower level (which, in my opinion, can help facilitate new ideas)\nAbility to work with function transformations such as vmap, pmap, jit, and grad (PyTorch has grad… yes I know… but applying grad to a stateless function makes much more intuitive sense than applying it to some stateful module!).\n\nThis might sound like an advertisement for JAX (which might be coming up in a future blog post!), but it is really to set the stage for functorch. functorch is a library that allows you to accomplish nearly all of the above, but in PyTorch! The basic idea is to purify stateful PyTorch modules into stateless functions like this (source):\nimport torch\nimport functorch\nfrom functorch import make_functional\n\nmodel = torch.nn.Linear(3, 3)\nfunc_model, params = make_functional(model)\nAs functorch is relatively new, there aren’t many examples out there showing how to use the library. So the goal of the rest of this post is to provide a simple example for creating an image classifier using functorch and PyTorch and updating the weights using SGD (no torch.optim!).\nHere is the code:\nimport torch\nimport torchplate\nfrom torchplate import experiment\nfrom torchplate import utils\nimport functorch\nfrom functorch import grad, grad_and_value\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\nfrom rsbox import ml\n# import torchopt\nimport requests\nfrom tqdm.auto import tqdm\nimport cloudpickle as cp\nfrom urllib.request import urlopen\n\n\n\nclass Net(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(3*32*32, 120)\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)\n        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 16)\n        self.fc4 = nn.Linear(16, 3)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)\n        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))\n        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))\n        x = F.relu(self.fc3(x))\n        x = self.fc4(x)\n        return x\n\n\n\nclass OptExp:\n    def __init__(self): \n        self.model_module = Net()\n        self.criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\n        dataset = cp.load(urlopen(\"https://stanford.edu/~rsikand/assets/datasets/mini_cifar.pkl\")) \n        self.trainloader, self.testloader = torchplate.utils.get_xy_loaders(dataset)\n        self.model, self.params = functorch.make_functional(self.model_module)  # init network \n    \n\n    def predict(self, x):\n        \"\"\"returns logits\"\"\"\n        assert self.model is not None\n        assert self.params is not None\n        logits = self.model(self.params, x)\n        return logits \n\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def sgd_step(params, gradients, lr):\n        \"\"\"one gradient step for updating the weights\"\"\"\n        updated_params = []\n        for param, gradient in zip(params, gradients):\n            update = param - (lr * gradient)\n            updated_params.append(update)\n        \n        return tuple(updated_params)\n    \n\n    @staticmethod\n    def stateless_loss(params, model, criterion, batch):\n        \"\"\"\n        Need to perform forward pass and loss calculation in one function\n        since we need gradients w.r.t params (must be args[0]).

    "text": "2. Why study multi-task learning and meta-learning?\n\nHow can we enable agents to learn a breadth of skills in the real world?\n\nBecause each time we have to train a supervised signal\n\nSo the goal is to learn representations across tasks\n\n\nAside (common paradigm to learn representations): initialize well (not randomly) –> fine-tune on new task.\n\nThis is harder for RL than NLP because NLP has the entire wikipedia to use but robotic common sense representations are not as straightforward (maybe we need a common robot embedding?)\n\n\nEvolution:\n\nEarly in CV: hand-design features, train SVM on-top\nModern CV: end-to-end training, no hand-engineering\n\nAllows us to handle unstructured inputs without understanding it\n\nNow why meta-learning? Three reasons…\n\nDon’t have large dataset at the outset to pre-train on or use in end-to-end SL manner (med imaging, robotics, etc.)\n\nEven more so: long-tail data samples (e.g., self-driving won’t catch all edge cases)\n\nMEL techniques can help with this (kinda… not the main focus tho)\n\n\nQuickly learn something new (few-shot learning)\n\nLots of open problems"

My experience was nothing short of amazing, and I definately learned a ton. While I had a lot of machine learning engineering experience prior to coming to insitro, I lacked knowledge of industry tools. At insitro, I was able to broaden my horizons and learn about concepts such as Amazon AWS, EC2, Batch; Weights and Biases; Git and Github pull requests; PyTorch distributed; and much more."
